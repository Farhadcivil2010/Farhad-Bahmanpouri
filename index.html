  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>UAWOS – Unmanned Airborne Water Observing System</strong><br>
      Collaborative project with top European institutions (e.g., TUM, DTU) and companies to establish UAS-based hydrometry as a standard for remote river monitoring. Key goals include reducing costs (by 2–3 times), enabling contactless discharge measurements (<15% error), enhancing hydraulic model input, and validating EO-based water level observations.
